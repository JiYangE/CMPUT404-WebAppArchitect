Comment on changes
====================

For part 1, I almost deleted every existing css from the original pages. I am using the bootstrap.min.css and some of my own css for this part.

There are many changes. When using bootstrap, I basically focus on using the grid system to make some of the content position looks more fit. Also I changed the background image of the entire page and for some pre block, I use another notebook style background.

Since hx (h1, h2...) elements are kind of title or subtitle stuff, I changed them to center aligned. For tables, I added a border for them.

For the top pre paragraph, I changed it to center aligned, with a notebook paper background.

For p elements, I added a text indentation of 3em, also to make the space looks better I added the top padding to 5px.

The original color of links looks bad on my page, I changed the color and the color when the mouse hover up.

Other changes are minor changes.

The screenshots are in part1 folder. I tried to capture the entire page but the img size are huge (For page 3 it was 36mb). So I just screenshot a little part of each page.
